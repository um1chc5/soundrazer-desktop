# 07 — Disk usage, cache, and uninstall

Status: Done (Phase 1 — WAV→FLAC canonical stems + stale-staging sweep)

What this covers: everywhere the app writes to disk, what the realistic footprint is,
where the genuine disk-abuse risks are, and what the uninstallers do and do not
remove.

## Where everything lives

| Data | Windows | Linux | Removed on uninstall? |
|---|---|---|---|
| App code + embedded runtime | `%ProgramFiles64%\SoundRazer Desktop` | `~/.local/share/soundrazer` | **Yes** |
| Model cache | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\SoundRazer Desktop\models` | `~/.cache/soundrazer-desktop/models` | **No** |
| Config (`ui.json`) | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\SoundRazer Desktop\ui.json` | `~/.local/share/soundrazer-desktop/ui.json` | **No** |
| Projects (originals + stems + exports) | `Documents\SoundRazer Desktop` | `~/Music/SoundRazer Desktop` | **No** |
| Downloaded FFmpeg | `$INSTDIR` (beside the app) | `~/.local/share/soundrazer/app/` | Yes (Windows) |

Resolved in [`ui_entrypoint.py`](../../app/ui_entrypoint.py) (`writable_dirs()`) and
[`tools.py`](../../app/sound_razor/tools.py).

### Why models are not in the app folder

Deliberate, and the reason is documented in `ui_entrypoint.py`: writing to Program
Files needs admin rights that a plain double-click shortcut does not have, so config
and the multi-hundred-MB model cache go to per-user app data instead. The same
`writable_dirs()` handles the OneDrive-redirected Documents case via `known_folder()`.

## Measured footprint

Real numbers from a Linux install with four projects:

| Item | Size |
|---|---:|
| Model cache (`models/`) | **455 MB** |
| Projects (4 songs) | **1.3 GB** |
| — of which stems | ~1.1 GB |
| — of which originals | ~160 MB |
| Setup stack (torch, onnxruntime, librosa, yt-dlp) | ~1.3–1.8 GB |
| Embedded runtime (Windows) | ~38 MB |

Model cache contents, per file:

| File | Size | Loaded when |
|---|---:|---|
| `lead_rhythm_listra92.ckpt` | 337 MB | guitar split |
| `955717e8-8726e21a.th` (`htdemucs`) | 84 MB | 4-stem |
| `5c90dfd2-34c22ccb.th` (`htdemucs_6s`) | 55 MB | 6-stem (default) |

## The real risk: stem amplification, not cache

Cache is **bounded** — models are lazy, one-time, and finite (455 MB total, and the
app never re-downloads a validated file). The genuine growth is **projects**, because
canonical stems are stored as **44.1 kHz stereo 16-bit WAV = 10.1 MB per stem per
minute** — lossless, uncompressed.

Measured against a 3.7-minute song:

```
original.wav    21 MB
6 stems        187 MB      <- ~9x the original
```

A full 6-stem run on a 4-minute song is ~242 MB of stems. Worst case, a **guitar
split keeps everything**: the original guitar stem *plus* both halves:

```
guitar.wav      39.5 MB    <- kept, no longer needed once split
lead.wav        79.0 MB
rhythm.wav      79.0 MB
                          ~198 MB for one stem
```

So the ordering of concern is:

1. **Projects / stems** — unbounded, and grows ~9x per imported song. This is the only
   thing that meaningfully accumulates.
2. **Export copies** — every export writes *new* files into `exports/` and **nothing
   ever deletes old ones**. Re-exporting the same song in another format adds a full
   set; re-exporting the same format overwrites by filename. Repeatedly changing
   formats grows this without limit.
3. **Orphaned staging directories** — `.separation-*`, `.youtube-*`, `.import-*`,
   `.exports-*`, `.guitar-split-*`, `.stems-*`, `.model-download-*`. Normal runs clean
   these up (most use `TemporaryDirectory`), but an interrupted run leaves one behind
   and **nothing ever sweeps them**. See
   [06 — Close behavior](06-close-behavior.md).
4. **Upload buffer** — `/api/import` accepts up to **2 GB** per upload
   (`self.body_size(2 * 1024**3)`), streamed to a temp dir, then **copied** into the
   project via `import_project`. A single import therefore briefly needs ~2x the file
   size in free space.
5. **Cover images** — small, content-addressed (`cover-<sha256[:20]>`), and skipped
   when already present, so effectively bounded.

There is **no** disk-space precheck anywhere, and **no** cache size cap or eviction.
A user on a small SSD could fill the disk mid-separation with no warning; the failure
would surface as a confusing FFmpeg or model error rather than "out of space".

## Uninstall behavior

**Windows** (`installer/SoundRazer.nsis`, `Section "Uninstall"`) removes only:

- `$INSTDIR` contents (app, `sound_razor/`, `runtime/`, `launch.bat`, `ui_entrypoint.py`,
  docs, icon) and `$INSTDIR` itself
- Start Menu folder and the desktop shortcut
- The `HKLM` uninstall registry key

It **never touches** `%LOCALAPPDATA%\SoundRazer Desktop` (models + config) or
`Documents\SoundRazer Desktop` (projects). Consequence: uninstall then reinstall keeps
your ~455 MB of models and skips re-downloading. To fully clean up, the user must
delete `%LOCALAPPDATA%\SoundRazer Desktop` manually.

**Linux** (`installer/install-linux.sh --uninstall`) matches this exactly: it removes
the prefix, launcher, `.desktop` entry, and icon, and prints the three preserved paths
so the user knows what remains.

## Planned change

1. **Switch canonical stem storage from WAV to FLAC** — done (see below). `combine_other()`
   keeps its float32 WAV intermediate; only the final stored stem is FLAC. `guitar_split.py`
   reads/writes FLAC via `soundfile`. Web player audio route serves `audio/flac` for `.flac`
   stems, `audio/wav` for legacy `.wav` stems. Backward compatible: existing `.wav` stems
   are still detected and played.
2. **Offer to delete the model cache on uninstall** — not done (see remaining work).
3. **Prune `guitar.wav` after a successful guitar split** — done implicitly: new projects
   store `guitar.flac` only when no split exists; once split into `lead.flac` + `rhythm.flac`,
   `guitar.flac` is excluded from the stem list. Legacy `guitar.wav` projects behave the same.
4. **Add a disk-space precheck** before a job — not done (see remaining work).
5. **Sweep stale staging directories at startup** — done in spec 06 (shared implementation:
   `Library.sweep_stale_staging()`, called at end of `Library.__init__`).
6. **Surface sizes in the UI** — not done (see remaining work).
7. **Document the 9x amplification** in the README — not done (see remaining work).

### Canonical stems: WAV → FLAC (done)

[03 — Output formats](03-output-formats.md) chose WAV as the canonical working format and
that reasoning still holds for *why not hand the separator MP3/FLAC directly* (guitar split
needs raw samples, `combine_other()` needs float headroom, playback needs a decodable file).
It does not rule out FLAC specifically: FLAC is lossless (bit-exact round trip, `soundfile`
decodes it natively) and compresses PCM audio to roughly 50–60% of WAV size.

Implemented:

- `pipeline.py`: `create_separator(output_format="FLAC")`; `combine_other()` mixes to
  float32 WAV then encodes to FLAC before storing.
- `guitar_split.py`: writes `lead.flac` / `rhythm.flac` via `soundfile` (FLAC subtype);
  reads FLAC source natively.
- `store.py`: stem detection matches both `.wav` and `.flac`; legacy `.wav` stems still
  listed and played.
- `library.py`: separation CLI output checked as `.flac`; guitar-split input is `guitar.flac`.
- `server.py`: audio route serves `audio/flac` for `.flac` names, `audio/wav` otherwise.
- `web/js/audio.js`: stem color lookup and guitar split button keyed on `.flac`.

Expected reduction: **~40–50% off stem storage on every project**.

## Remaining work

- [ ] Confirm the pywebview host decodes FLAC in `<audio>` before shipping the
      WAV→FLAC change.
- [ ] Add the uninstall prompt for models/settings (NSIS) and `--purge` (Linux).
- [ ] Implement the disk-space precheck with a clear error message.
- [ ] Decide whether old exports should be replaced wholesale per export run.
- [ ] Add per-project / total size display and selective cleanup to the UI.
- [ ] Document stem-size amplification in the README.

## Constraints

- Do not move the model cache into `$INSTDIR`; the per-user location is a confirmed
  fix for the Program Files write-permission problem.
- Do not change `writable_dirs()` / `known_folder()`; the OneDrive-aware behavior is a
  confirmed fix.
- Any cleanup must be conservative: known prefixes only, never follow symlinks, never
  delete outside the projects root, and never delete data the user did not create
  through the app.
